# 11-Stage Pipelined Dual-Issue Sony Cell SPU

A SystemVerilog implementation of a simplified **11-Stage Sony Cell Synergistic Processing Unit (SPU)** processor core. The project models a dual-issue, deeply pipelined execution engine with separate even/odd instruction pipes, 128-bit SIMD-style register data paths, hazard-aware issue logic, branch handling, local-store memory support, and a Python assembler for loading SPU-like assembly programs into simulation.


## Main Features

### Dual-Issue Pipeline

The top-level processor fetches two 32-bit instructions per cycle from instruction memory and attempts to issue them together into the appropriate execution pipes. The program counter advances by 8 bytes on normal operation, reflecting two-instruction fetch granularity.

Key capabilities:

- Two-instruction fetch from instruction memory.
- Even-pipe and odd-pipe instruction classification.
- Single-cycle issue of compatible instruction pairs.
- Selective single issue when hazards or structural conflicts prevent safe dual issue.
- Stop-instruction detection for controlled simulation termination.

### 11-Stage-Oriented Execution Model

The design models deep SPU-like execution latency through an execute subsystem backed by per-pipe packet arrays. The top-level sets `LAST_STAGE = 8` for the execute pipe arrays, while the full design flow includes fetch, decode, and execute/writeback staging to represent an 11-stage processor organization.

Pipeline packet structs carry:

- Source operand values.
- Destination register addresses.
- Instruction IDs.
- Latency metadata.
- Register-write controls.
- Instruction-order metadata for dual-issue bookkeeping.

### Separate Even and Odd Execution Pipes

The Cell SPU architecture groups instructions into even and odd execution classes. This implementation follows that idea by decoding each instruction into an `Instr_type` and routing it through either the even or odd pipe.

Representative responsibilities:

- **Even pipe:** arithmetic, logical, compare, immediate, floating-point, multiply, and other computation-heavy operations.
- **Odd pipe:** local-store access, branches, byte/quadword shifts and rotates, gather operations, and control-flow-oriented operations.

### Hazard Detection and Issue Control

The top-level issue logic checks for hazards before allowing instructions to enter execution. It accounts for dependencies both between the two instructions currently being decoded and against instructions already in the execution pipelines.

Implemented hazard categories include:

- Register-file hazards from instructions entering execute.
- Pipeline hazards against in-flight destination registers.
- Decode-stage dependencies between instruction 1 and instruction 2.
- Structural conflicts such as both issued instructions targeting the same destination register.
- Stall control that preserves fetch/decode state until the hazard clears.

### Forwarding / Bypass Network

The execute module includes forwarding logic that compares source registers against destinations in both even and odd pipeline arrays. When a newer result is available in flight, the operand forwarded to execution is replaced with the pipeline result rather than waiting for register-file writeback.

Forwarded operands include:

- Even pipe: `RA`, `RB`, `RC`, and `RT` source data.
- Odd pipe: `RA`, `RB`, and `RT` source data.
- Results from both even and odd in-flight pipelines.

### Branch Handling and Pipeline Flushes

The odd execution path computes branch target addresses and branch-taken signals for direct, indirect, conditional, and link-style branch instructions. The top-level program counter can redirect to a branch target, and the execute stage exposes branch flush signals to clear younger work when control flow changes.

Branch support includes examples such as:

- Relative and absolute branches.
- Branch-and-set-link forms.
- Indirect branches.
- Conditional zero / not-zero branches.
- Halfword conditional branch variants.

### 128-Bit SIMD-Style Register File

The register file contains 128 registers, each 128 bits wide, matching the broad-vector flavor of the Cell SPU. It supports separate even and odd writeback ports and exposes multiple source operands to the two issue lanes.

Notable characteristics:

- 128 x 128-bit architectural register file.
- Separate write enables for even and odd results.
- Multiple read ports for dual-issue operand fetch.
- Reset initialization of all registers.

### Local Store Memory Model

The `local_store` module models SPU-style local memory access with 128-bit memory entries and quadword load/store behavior. It is initialized with sample floating-point matrix data, making it useful for workloads that exercise vectorized memory operations.

### Python Assembler

The repository includes a Python assembler that converts SPU-like assembly text into hexadecimal machine instructions for the instruction memory.

Assembler features:

- Two-pass label resolution.
- Register parsing and bounds checking.
- Immediate-width validation.
- Branch-offset calculation.
- Encoding support for RR, RRR, RI7, RI10, RI16, RI18, and special instruction formats.
- Output to `instructions.txt`, which is loaded by the SystemVerilog instruction memory.

The assembler currently defines 99 mnemonics across the supported instruction formats, giving the RTL a broad instruction surface to decode and execute.

## Detailed Design Breakdown

### Program Counter and Instruction Memory

- The program counter normally increments by **8 bytes** so the front end can fetch a pair of 32-bit instructions each cycle.
- When a branch is taken, the program counter is redirected to the computed branch target address instead of the sequential `PC + 8` value.
- Stall and stop conditions feed the `pc_write` control so the front end only advances when the pipeline can safely accept new work.
- Instruction memory is modeled as a **2 kB asynchronous-read memory** initialized at simulation start from `instructions.txt` with `$readmemh`.
- The memory interface always presents two adjacent instructions to the pipeline, which lets the issue logic decide whether to dual-issue, single-issue, or inject hardware no-ops.

### IF/ID Register and Dual Decode

- The IF/ID register preserves the current instruction pair across stalls and can be flushed when control flow redirects.
- Because the processor fetches two instructions at a time, it instantiates two decode units and decodes both instructions in parallel.
- Each decode unit extracts `RT`, `RA`, `RB`, and `RC`, assigns an internal instruction ID, reports expected latency, classifies the instruction as even-pipe or odd-pipe, and marks which register fields are true sources for dependency checks.

### Hazard Detection, Stall, and Flush Logic

The hazard unit handles the core complications of dual issue: two instructions can conflict with each other, with older instructions in the register-fetch stage, or with older instructions still moving through the even and odd pipelines.

- **RAW / data hazards:** instruction 1 or instruction 2 may need a source register that is still being produced by an older instruction. The design checks hazards in register fetch and across both in-flight execution pipes. Instruction 2 also has a decode-stage dependency case when it reads the destination of instruction 1.
- **WAW / structural hazards:** when both decoded instructions target the same destination register, the design stalls instruction 2 and issues instruction 1 first so writeback order remains unambiguous.
- **Same-pipe conflicts:** if both decoded instructions would route to the same pipe in the same cycle, the issue logic falls back to single issue instead of over-subscribing the pipe.
- **Control hazards:** the design predicts branches as not taken. When a branch is actually taken, the pipeline asserts flush controls and redirects the program counter to the branch target.
- **Forwardability checks:** the execute subsystem tracks when results in the even or odd pipe are mature enough to forward. If the newest dependency cannot be forwarded or read from the register file on the next cycle, the hazard logic stalls instead of issuing unsafe work.

### ID/RF Register and Packetized Execution

The module named `ID_EX_reg.sv` acts as the ID/RF pipeline boundary in this implementation. It captures decoded instruction metadata, including instruction bits, IDs, latencies, destination registers, register-write controls, and issue order. The execute module then packages those fields together with register operands into pipeline packets that move through the even and odd execution pipes.

### Execution, Forwarding, and Writeback

- The execute module owns the register-file instance, the odd-pipe instance, the even-pipe instance, and the combinational forwarding network.
- Each pipe models **8 pipeline registers including RF/EX1**, which represent the back end of the 11-stage organization after fetch, decode, and register fetch are accounted for.
- `even_execute.sv` and `odd_execute.sv` implement the combinational functional-unit behavior for their respective pipe classes.
- Forwarding logic compares `RA`, `RB`, `RC`, and `RT` sources against destinations in both pipes and substitutes in-flight results when available.
- The final forwarding/writeback stages drive separate even and odd writeback paths into the 128-bit register file.

### Stop Behavior

- The processor uses stop logic to transition from active execution into hardware no-op issue once a `stop` instruction is observed.
- If `stop` appears as the second instruction in a fetched pair, the design can still allow the first instruction to issue when it is safe; otherwise it suppresses new work with no-ops.
- Branch redirects take priority over stop behavior, so a taken branch can override a pending stop and resume execution from the branch target.
- The top-level testbench waits for `stop` to remain asserted for 25 cycles before ending simulation, reducing the chance of terminating during a transient stop that is superseded by a branch.

## Instruction Support

The implementation uses internal instruction IDs for a broad subset of SPU-like operations. Supported categories include:

- Integer arithmetic and subtract forms.
- Logical operations and immediate logical operations.
- Compare equal / greater-than operations.
- Immediate load forms.
- Shifts and rotates across halfwords, words, bytes, and quadwords.
- Floating-point add, subtract, multiply, fused multiply-add, and fused multiply-subtract.
- Multiply and multiply-accumulate forms.
- Gather and count operations.
- Quadword loads and stores.
- Relative, absolute, indirect, conditional, and link branches.
- NOP, load-NOP, and stop instructions.

The assembler instruction table is organized by binary instruction format:

| Format | Count | Examples |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| RR | 38 | `a`, `and`, `xor`, `fa`, `mpy`, `lqx`, `stqx` |
| RRR | 3 | `fma`, `fms`, `mpya` |
| RI7 | 19 | `shli`, `rotqbyi`, `bi`, `biz`, `cntb` |
| RI10 | 20 | `ai`, `andi`, `ceqi`, `mpyi`, `lqd`, `stqd` |
| RI16 | 15 | `il`, `lqa`, `br`, `brsl`, `brz` |
| RI18 | 1 | `ila` |
| Special | 3 | `nop`, `lnop`, `stop` |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 for the assembler.
- A SystemVerilog-capable simulator for RTL simulation, such as Questa, Xcelium, VCS, Verilator, or another simulator that supports the SystemVerilog constructs used in this project.

### Assemble the Default Program

```bash
python3 assembler.py
```

This reads `assembly.txt` and writes `instructions.txt`.

### Run a Simulation

Simulator command lines vary by tool. A typical flow is:

1. Compile the SystemVerilog source files.
2. Use `top_level_tb.sv` as the top-level testbench.
3. Ensure the simulation working directory contains `instructions.txt`, because `instruction_memory.sv` loads it with `$readmemh`.
4. Run until the testbench observes the `stop` signal held high for the configured number of cycles or until the safety timeout is reached.

Example file order for simulators that require package-first compilation:

```text
packet_pkg.sv
program_counter.sv
instruction_memory.sv
register_file.sv
local_store.sv
IF_ID_reg.sv
ID_EX_reg.sv
decode.sv
even_execute.sv
odd_execute.sv
even_pipe.sv
odd_pipe.sv
execute.sv
top_level.sv
top_level_tb.sv
```

---

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Edit assembly.txt with an SPU-like program.
$EDITOR assembly.txt

# 2. Assemble into the hex image consumed by instruction memory.
python3 assembler.py

# 3. Compile and run the RTL with your preferred SystemVerilog simulator.
# Example only; adapt flags and source ordering to your simulator.
<simulator> packet_pkg.sv program_counter.sv instruction_memory.sv register_file.sv \
  local_store.sv IF_ID_reg.sv ID_EX_reg.sv decode.sv even_execute.sv \
  odd_execute.sv even_pipe.sv odd_pipe.sv execute.sv top_level.sv top_level_tb.sv
```

## Current Limitations and Future Improvements

This repository is an academic/portfolio RTL project rather than a production CPU core. Potential next steps include:

- Expand self-checking assertions in the testbenches.
- Add instruction-by-instruction golden-model comparison from Python.
- Document all instruction encodings in a generated table.
